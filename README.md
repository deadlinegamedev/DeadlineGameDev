##Episode 5: Clean Screen

Yo dawg! I heard you like phones so I put a phone in your phone. It's a little dirty though, so wipe the screen with your finger to clean it.

##Episode 4: Happy Bird

You've been reincarnated as an ugly bird and the only thing to do is eat, sleep, fly, repeat. Tap the screen to flap your wings (which I forgot to implement^^) and move to the flies to eat them.
